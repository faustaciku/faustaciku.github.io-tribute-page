          <h4>About</h4>
          <p class="about-section">
            Jacque Fresco (born 13 March 1916) is a structural designer, social
            engineer, architectural designer, philosopher of science, concept
            artist, educator, and futurist. His central approach is to use
            “science as a method applied to social concern,” which is also one
            of the key tenets of the Technocracy Inc. movement, of which Jacque
            was a member for a while. Fresco has designed, invented and patented
            a large number of things, including a version of 3D cinema without
            the use of glasses, a technique for three-dimensional x-ray units,
            and the first airbag.

      <h4>Quotes from Jacque Fresco</h4>

      <div class="qoute-topic">On the Larry King Show in 1974:</div>
      <div class="qoute">
        “It would take ten years to change the surface of the Earth. To rebuild
        the world into a second garden of Eden…"
      </div>
      <div class="qoute-topic">On the Great Depression:</div>
      <div class="qoute">
        “During the Depression it was obvious to me that something was wrong
        with our culture; the way we did things, the use of money. Because there
        were all kinds of things available in the store windows. Radios,
        dishwashers… but people just didn’t have the money. Of course, I
        realized then it wasn’t money that people needed, what they needed was
        access to the necessities of life.“
      </div>

      <div class="qoute-topic">On Human Nature:</div>
      <div class="qoute">
        "It is not that people are evil or greedy. The conditions that socially
        support the system force us to behave in socially offensive ways."
      </div>
      <div class="qoute-topic">On Love:</div>
      <div class="qoute">
        “In the future…you will love as many people that you meet that are
        lovable, and you can’t help that. And that’s where the future is going."
      </div>
      <div class="qoute-topic">On Machines:</div>
      <div class="qoute">
        “We don’t have enough machines! This is the problem. We have too many
        humans in high places that are insufficient mentally to solve problems.
        It isn’t humanism that got rid of slavery, it is technology. Machines
        are cheaper and faster than slaves."
