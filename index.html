          <h4>About</h4>
          <p class="about-section mt-3">
            Jacque Fresco (born 13 March 1916) is a structural designer, social
            engineer, architectural designer, philosopher of science, concept
            artist, educator, and futurist. His central approach is to use
            “science as a method applied to social concern,” which is also one
            of the key tenets of the Technocracy Inc. movement, of which Jacque
            was a member for a while. Fresco has designed, invented and patented
            a large number of things, including a version of 3D cinema without
            the use of glasses, a technique for three-dimensional x-ray units,
            and the first airbag.

          <p class="about-section mt-3">
            The Venus Project is a non-profit organization that recognizes the
            important connection between global resource mismanagement and
            problems such as war, climate change, poverty, and hunger. In the
            broader context, these are all detrimental results of the current
            socio-economic operating system. In response to these challenges,
            our organization presents solutions through the holistic application
            of science and technology; two areas in which recent advancements
            hold the potential to make far-reaching positive impacts.

        <div class="qoute-topic mt-3">On the Larry King Show in 1974:</div>
        <div class="qoute">
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> It would take ten years to
          change the surface of the Earth. To rebuild the world into a second
          garden of Eden… <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="qoute-topic">On the Great Depression:</div>
        <div class="qoute">
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> During the Depression it was
          obvious to me that something was wrong with our culture; the way we
          did things, the use of money. Because there were all kinds of things
          available in the store windows. Radios, dishwashers… but people just
          didn’t have the money. Of course, I realized then it wasn’t money that
          people needed, what they needed was access to the necessities of life.
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="qoute-topic">On Human Nature:</div>
        <div class="qoute">
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> It is not that people are evil
          or greedy. The conditions that socially support the system force us to
          behave in socially offensive ways.
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="qoute-topic">On Love:</div>
        <div class="qoute">
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> In the future…you will love as
          many people that you meet that are lovable, and you can’t help that.
          And that’s where the future is going.
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="qoute-topic">On Machines:</div>
        <div class="qoute">
          <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> We don’t have enough machines!
          This is the problem. We have too many humans in high places that are
          insufficient mentally to solve problems. It isn’t humanism that got
          rid of slavery, it is technology. Machines are cheaper and faster than
          slaves. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right"></i>
